Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage.

In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

US Yield Curve. Get United States yield curve. Government Treasury Rates. ICE BofA US Corporate Bond Indices.  The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. Qualifying securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity at the time of issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalance date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

They are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market.  Short-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. Short-term interest rates are based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

Use the composite leading indicator (CLI).  It is designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles showing fluctuation of the economic activity around its long term potential level.  CLIs show short-term economic movements in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Get Short-term interest rates.  They are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market.  Short-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. Short-term interest rates are based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth. Query the Geo Fred API for regional economic data by series group.  The series group ID is found by using `fred_search` and the `series_id` parameter. \n",

The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

US Yield Curve. Get United States yield curve. Government Treasury Rates. ICE BofA US Corporate Bond Indices.  The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. Qualifying securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity at the time of issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalance date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

US Yield Curve. Get United States yield curve. Government Treasury Rates. ICE BofA US Corporate Bond Indices.  The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market.

The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

US Yield Curve. Get United States yield curve. Government Treasury Rates. ICE BofA US Corporate Bond Indices.  The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. Qualifying securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity at the time of issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalance date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

Use the composite leading indicator (CLI).  It is designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles showing fluctuation of the economic activity around its long term potential level.  CLIs show short-term economic movements in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Get Short-term interest rates.  They are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market.  Short-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. Short-term interest rates are based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

The €STR is published on each TARGET2 business day based on transactions conducted and settled on the previous TARGET2 business day (the reporting date “T”) with a maturity date of T+1 which are deemed to have been executed at arm’s length and thus reflect market rates in an unbiased way. European Central Bank Interest Rates.

US Yield Curve. Get United States yield curve. Government Treasury Rates. ICE BofA US Corporate Bond Indices.  The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. Qualifying securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity at the time of issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalance date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

CLIs show short-term economic movements in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Get Short-term interest rates.  They are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market.  Short-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. Short-term interest rates are based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

European Central Bank Interest Rates.  The Governing Council of the ECB sets the key interest rates for the euro area:  - The interest rate on the main refinancing operations (MRO), which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system. - The rate on the deposit facility, which banks may use to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. - The rate on the marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks from the Eurosystem.

US Yield Curve. Get United States yield curve. Government Treasury Rates. ICE BofA US Corporate Bond Indices.  The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. Qualifying securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity at the time of issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalance date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms.

US Yield Curve. Get United States yield curve. Government Treasury Rates. ICE BofA US Corporate Bond Indices.  The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. Qualifying securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity at the time of issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalance date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index is a component of the US Corporate Master Index. Moody Corporate Bond Index.  Moody's Aaa and Baa are investment bonds that acts as an index of the performance of all bonds given an Aaa or Baa rating by Moody's Investors Service respectively. These corporate bonds often are used in macroeconomics as an alternative to the federal ten-year Treasury Bill as an indicator of the interest rate. High Quality Market Corporate Bond.  The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",

It is designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles showing fluctuation of the economic activity around its long term potential level.  CLIs show short-term economic movements in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Get Short-term interest rates.  They are the rates at which short-term borrowings are effected between financial institutions or the rate at which short-term government paper is issued or traded in the market.  Short-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. Short-term interest rates are based on three-month money market rates where available. Typical standardised names are \"money market rate\" and \"treasury bill rate\". Get Long-term interest rates that refer to government bonds maturing in ten years.  Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.
