The HQM yield curve represents the high quality corporate bond market, i.e., corporate bonds rated AAA, AA, or A.  The HQM curve contains two regression terms. These terms are adjustment factors that blend AAA, AA, and A bonds into a single HQM yield curve that is the market-weighted average (MWA) quality of high quality bonds. Spot Rates.  The spot rates for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for discounting a pension liability at the same maturity. \n",
